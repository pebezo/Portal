Portal
======

Portal MVC is a Razor view helper that allows you to send blocks of HTML or JavaScript from a view or partial view to the layout view. 

This is helpful when you want to include various bits of JavaScript from a partial views right before closing of the HTML tag to optimize page rendering. You can also register requests for JavaScript / CSS files that should be included in the layout.
